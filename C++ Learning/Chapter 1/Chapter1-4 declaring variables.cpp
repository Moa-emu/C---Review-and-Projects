// Now we will breifly go over Declaring and initializing variables
// Breif definition of a variable in C++ 
// variable: represents a particular piece of your computerâ€™s memory that has been set aside for you to use to store, retrieve, and manipulate data


// variables come in different types for example look below
//  -boolean values(true or false)
//  -char: single character values
//  -strings: which are a data type that represents a sequence of characters. When using strings make sure that you use " " when initializing them 
//  -int: for intergers
//  -float: for single-precision floating point numbers ex: 3.14, 1.2e^-8
//  -double: for double-precision floating point numbers ex: just like a float but can hold more values 2.2e^-308. 
// There are also type modifiers such as short, long, signed and unsigned
//  -signed: this is a modifier that means a variable can store both positive and negative values
//  -unsigned: is a modifier that can only store positive values

// Here is something cool you can do with modifiers look below
// typedef unsigned short int ushort; this makes the variable ushort a unsigned, short interger.
// typedef will combine modifiers and types together in your variable so your variable will have all of those properties
// another way at looking at is you are basically creating a new modifier/type with an name that you create


// cin >> variable; that is a way for you to be able to use a variable to get an users input


#include<iostream>
// Below will allow us to be able to use strings in our code
#include <string>
using namespace std;

    cout<< "After the doctor has checked you out and consider you healthy she says that you can leave her office, on the topic of payment she says taht you do not need to worry about it. \n "<<endl;

    
    // We will make a mini game where to gain money the mainCharacter will go kill cow bandits
    // below you will see all of the variables that we are going to initialize
